# Campus-Recruitment-System

The Campus Recruitment Management System (CRMS) streamlines the recruitment process by managing interactions among admins, companies, and students. It uses PHP for backend functionality, HTML/CSS for designing the user interface, and MySQL for storing data in a database named crmsdb.

Implemented CRM-like functionalities, enabling companies to track and manage student applications, interviews, and hiring decisions efficiently.

The system supports deployment on web servers like XAMPP, WAMP as well as cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, making it accessible via http://localhost/crms and cloud-hosted domain.

Built automated data workflows like CRM processes to update candidate records, track application statuses, and notify stakeholders of key recruitment milestones.
